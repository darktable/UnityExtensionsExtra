# UnityExtensionsExtra
This package contains some useful development tools.

## Installation
Unity can not install dependent packages automatically at present, you have to install them manually:

You need to set your project's Api Compatibility Level to .NET 4.x first (menu: Edit > Project Settings > Player), then open the package manager window (menu: Window > Package Manager), select "Add package from git URL...", fill in this in the pop-up textbox: https://github.com/yuyang9119/UnityExtensionsExtra.git.
